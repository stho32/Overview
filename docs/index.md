# Overview

## Projects on GitHub

### Learning

I use a R report to direct my training and learning so I every day may 
get closer to the best version of myself.

  - [Learning Dashboard](Learning-Dashboard.html)

### The "basement"
  - [GitProjectTemplating](https://github.com/stho32/GitProjectTemplating) is a shell script that helps me derive github repositories from other github repositories by creating a copy, not a fork. I have a hand full of Repositories that are actually project templates. That makes having a default structure easier.
    - [ProjectTemplate-Empty](https://github.com/stho32/ProjectTemplate-Empty) Empty project template.
    - [ProjectTemplate-HTML](https://github.com/stho32/ProjectTemplate-HTML) HTML project template

  - [Prinzipien](https://github.com/stho32/Prinzipien) The principles I use as a base for my life. Every now and then I take some time and think about things and try to develop them. Sometimes motivated by a great book, sometimes just derived from the things that happen to me. (german)

  - [Programmiersprachenstack](https://github.com/stho32/Programmiersprachenstack) What programming languages do I use, why and what for. Sooner or later this will get included in my learning dashboard as those discisions directly influence what I am looking for when I learn new stuff. (german)

### R

R is an awesome statistical, functional language. 

  - [FinancialOverviewR](https://github.com/stho32/FinancialOverviewR) is a small library about personal finances. I wanted to fully automate my way to think about my money.

### Team Treehouse (teamtreehouse.com)

Taking part in the treehouse community and techdegree for javascript I have a bunch of github repositories that are only about that. You may have a look at them. Mostly I just "wrote what was required", sometimes I added funny things I wanted to try out additionally. I'll probably revisit them after I have finally created my random-git-repository-training-tool that I wanted to write for so long :p.
